/**
 * The IRCClient class offers semi-advanced functionality to manage connections to multiple IRC networks in which
 * multiple channels can be joined either as an active or passive member. When a channel is joined or another user joins
 * a channel the IRCClient queries a stored instance of an {@link GreetingsGenerator} to possibly generate a greeting
 * appropriate for the event. Similarly, it checks a {@link ResponseGenerator} for received messages and, if possible,
 * responds using them.
 *
 * Network management is done using {@link Network} instances that are collected in this class. Networks can be added
 * and removed after the IRCClient instance has been created. If the client is already connected and a network is added
 * / removed, the client will connect / disconnect accordingly.
 *
 * For additional monitoring, classes implementing {@link Listener} can register themselves as subscribers to this
 * client. Subscribers will be registered as event listeners to every network managed by this client.
