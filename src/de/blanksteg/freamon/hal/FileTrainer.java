     * time. This causes the garbage collector to spend large amounts of time gathering unreachable
     * references and clearing their memory, which makes the Java virtual machine abort the
     * execution. Due to this, we have to use the alternative method of buffering char values in
     * a one-time allocated array which does not suffer from the issue previously illustrated since
     * primitive values are allocated on the stack.
